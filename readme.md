# prank
some pranks I made for MACS ONLY (at the moment), you can play them on your friends if you're an asshole like I am

## how to
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/soops/prank

# CD into the folder of the prank you want
cd prank/keyboard # you can optionally cd into prank/keymouse, prank/keyboard or prank/mouse, they are all essentially run the same

# run them scripts fast
sh run.sh
```
