# prank
some pranks I made for **MACS ONLY** (at the moment), you can play them on your friends if you're an asshole like I am

## how to
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/soops/prank

# CD into the folder of the prank you want
cd prank/keyboard # you can optionally cd into prank/keymouse, prank/keyboard or prank/mouse, they essentially run the same

# run them scripts fast
sh run.sh
```

also, if you'd like logs of what the scripts are doing, you can check out the files they generate (`.keyboard.out` and `.mouse.out`, usually in their folders)

as always, remember to stay yBtVVxhB5what the f1PjcprFgnvbeuck is going oJ88xJSYw8laOKqan with my computPE8qlho2C6lWurKrON
